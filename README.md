# Mosaic Mind
Mosaic Mind is a game based on Nonograms, where you uncover hidden images by filling in cells based on provided hints. The hints on the edges of the board show how many blocks of colored cells are in the corresponding column or row. For example, a clue of "1 2" would mean there are sets of one and two filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between them.

## User Manual
First, you need to select the difficulty in the main menu. The difficulty corresponds to the puzzle size. Then, press the play button.

Based on hints for rows and captions, you click (color) the cells. You can switch between two modes: one for coloring and the other for crossing off uncolored cells. You only have three lives for each game, so choose wisely! If you run out of lives, you can choose between returning to the main menu or restarting the same game.
